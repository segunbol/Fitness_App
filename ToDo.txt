FOR GYM MODEL:(16/06/2024)
- Change the contactPersonUserName,contactPersonLastName and contactPersonFirstName to a List of UserIds 
referenced to User Model, i.e, before a Gym can be registered, the user(gym owner) must have created a 
profile, become admin and can assign users to be admin of its gym

Currently working on the Transaction Process (16/06/2024) - Project has not gone live yet
-To Create a inflow Transaction, the thought processes are :-
        1. Have a true or false case for if the customer has paid or not, then save all in the same Inflow transaction Model
            - In this case, the database will do the sieving 
        2. Have a seperate model for paid and debtors --- but this is unnecessary.
- How do I construct the process?
